While there’s a lot of unknowns in the data–particularly across entries for “Race/Ethnicity”+“Gender”–and also because we don’t have the population estimates for phases 1A and 1B broken down by race/age/gender, the data presented by DSHS struggles to paint an incomplete picture of the profile of vaccinated individuals. That said, the charts below attempt to breakdown that data with as much clarity as possible across all known and unknown classifications.\n\n\n\nThe next chart is broken up into six different panels–one for each classification of a race or ethnicity. Within each of those panels, there’s two sets of five-columned bar charts which represent the reported gender. The dark blue colored bars (facing upwards) represent the female population within each race and ethnicity classification while the gray colored bars (facing downwards) represent the male population within each race and ethnicity classification. Each column within a set of blue or gray colored bars represents a different age group.\n\n\n\nVaccines + Access\n\nWhere Inaccessible Populations Live in Texas\nFrom Vaccine Hubs\n\n\n\nFrom Pharmacies\n\n\n\nPhotography Credit\nPhoto by Ryan Magsino on Unsplash\n\n\n\n",

At a high level, this chart is a single box that represents everyone in Texas aged 16 years and older. Within the box, you can see how much of is made up of eligible phases and how much of it is made up of the remaining population aged 16 years and older. And then, two lines mark the following:\nDoses Shipped: How many doses have been shipped compared to the entire 16+ population?\nPersons Fully Vaccinated: How many people have been fully vaccinated compared to the entire 16+ population?\n\n\n\nNational Comparison\n\n\n\nDistribution Trends\nThe next chart captures where the reported supply of doses has been distributed, by the type of vaccine provider. The state classifies provider types, which allows to see very simply: what kinds of providers have recently received shipments of doses and how much were they shipped?\n\n\n\nSimilar to the last one, this chart focuses on reported availability. In other words, how much of the shipped doses are provider types reporting to be still available at the time the chart was generated?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVaccine Pace Tracker\nThe last tool to track the pace of distribution is an interactive comparison of the state and counties across Texas. The tool allows users to track the statewide pace of vaccine progress and the county-level pace of vaccine progress. Because the state is only focused on the population aged 16 and above, we only measure progress against this population.\nQuestion | Why do they only measure the population aged 16 and above?\n According to the Texas Department of State Health Services, “At this time, experts do not know how safe the COVID-19 vaccine is for children. People 16 years old and older are currently eligible to get the vaccine if they are in a priority population.”\nThe two charts represent the entire populations of the state and selected county. In the boxes below, there are three indicators.\nDose Distribution: This box shows how many doses have been administered out of the doses that have actually been allocated to that entity (either the state or the selected county).\nDaily Average: This is an ongoing calculation of daily averages that starts on Dec 15. The only thing it considers is how many doses are going into arms each day.\nWhen 70% is Vaccinated: Based on that daily average and knowing most of the approved vaccines require two doses, this box tries to guesstimate when 70% of the population aged 16 and older will be vaccinated. This is not a herd immunity projection, rather a look ahead as to when most of the population aged 16 and older will likely be vaccinated.\n\n\n\n\nPhotography Credit\nPhoto by CDC on Unsplash\n\n\n\n",
