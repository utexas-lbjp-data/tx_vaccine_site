While there’s a lot of unknowns in the data–particularly across entries for “Race/Ethnicity”+“Gender”–and also because we don’t have the population estimates for phases 1A and 1B broken down by race/age/gender, the data presented by DSHS struggles to paint an incomplete picture of the profile of vaccinated individuals. That said, the charts below attempt to breakdown that data with as much clarity as possible across all known and unknown classifications.\n\n\n\nThe next chart is broken up into six different panels–one for each classification of a race or ethnicity. Within each of those panels, there’s two sets of five-columned bar charts which represent the reported gender. The dark blue colored bars (facing upwards) represent the female population within each race and ethnicity classification while the gray colored bars (facing downwards) represent the male population within each race and ethnicity classification. Each column within a set of blue or gray colored bars represents a different age group.\n\n\n\nVaccines + Access\n\nWhere Inaccessible Populations Live in Texas\nFrom Vaccine Hubs\n\n\n\nFrom Pharmacies\n\n\n\nPhotography Credit\nPhoto by Ryan Magsino on Unsplash\n\n\n\n",

We use population and demographic estimates from ACS-2019, which gives us the most recent figures on population. All graphs and analysis has been done in R with the help of different packages. We welcome any comment or suggestion related to this website. Please reach out to us if you have any feedback or want to report an error by creating an issue on the source repository.\nEquity\nWe use DSHS data on COVID-19 cases, deaths and vaccinations, which is published with demographic breakdowns like age, gender and race/ethnicity. A percentage analysis is presented with bar charts, showing the percentage share of each race in vaccination, Covid-19 cases, deaths and overall population.\nFor example the share of white people in these four areas is calculated as\n\n\nItems\n\n\nEquation\n\n\n% of Doses administered\n\n\n\\[ \\scriptsize \\frac{\\text{No. doses administered to white people in Texas}} { \\text {Total  no. of doses administered in Texas}} * 100 \\]\n\n\n% of Cases\n\n\n\\[ \\scriptsize \\frac{ \\text{No. of white people identified with COVID-19 in Texas}} { \\text{Total no. of COVID-19 cases in Texas}} * 100 \\]\n\n\n% of Fatalities\n\n\n\\[ \\scriptsize \\frac{ \\text{No. of COVID-19 related deaths in white  population in Texas}} {\\text{Total no. of COVID-19 deaths in Texas}} * 100 \\]\n\n\n% of State Population\n\n\n\\[ \\scriptsize \\frac{\\text{No. of white people in Texas}} {\\text{Total  Population of Texas}}* 100 \\]\n\n\nAdministered doses is a summary figure of persons who have received a single dose and persons who are fully vaccinated. Similarly in the nexr graph we further split the demographics into gender and age group. A bar chart for each race shows the total number of people administered atleast one vaccine dose for each age group and each gender within that race. Same bar chart for the unknown gender category has also been created for all races that are mentioned in DSHS data.\nTo see the geographic accessability to vaccine sites, we take data on names and addresses of listed vaccine sites from DSHS. Using these addresses, we obtain the co-ordinates through Mapbox api. We then highlight the geographic areas which are 30 min drive away from each of vaccine sites by using Mapbox api. Using co-ordiantes of polygons that contain the area within 30 min drive of vaccine site, we calculate the number of people age 16 and above not living in these areas by using census block population estimates.\nProviders\nTo allow people to check the availability of vaccines in their areas, we provide the data obtained from DSHS website on vaccine sites locations and number of doses available at each site. Using this database, which is updated routinely, we provide a search option where people can search using name, street address or zip code for vaccine sites and the number of doses available at each site. Using leaflet api, we provide an interactive map of the search area with vaccine sites highlighted on the map.\nPace\nWe look at the pace of vaccination drive by taking data from DSHS which contains county wise information and is updated on daily basis to provide the following information:\n\n\nItems\n\n\nDetails\n\n\nTotal Doses Allocated\n\n\nTotal number of doses allocated to COVID-19 providers through the current week by provider county (all other measures are summed by recipient’s county of residence). Includes doses that will be shipping and arriving at providers this week.\n\n\nVaccine Doses Administered\n\n\nThe number of vaccine doses administered, number of people vaccinated with one dose and number of people fully vaccinated are aggregated by the recipient’s county of residence. Health care providers have 24 hours after a dose is administered to enter information into ImmTrac2, the Texas Immunization Registry. The data comes from vaccination records submitted by health care providers as of 11:59 the previous night.\n\n\nPeople Vaccinated with at least One Dose\n\n\nNumber of people vaccinated with one dose is defined as the number of people who have received at least one dose of COVID-19 vaccine.\n\n\nPeople Fully Vaccinated\n\n\nNumber of people fully vaccinated is defined as the number of people who have completed the full series (2 doses of Moderna or Pfizer vaccine), as outlined by the CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP).\n\n\nPopulation, 16+\n\n\n2019 Population Estimates available from the Texas Demographic Center at https://demographics.texas.gov/Data/TPEPP/Estimates/.\n\n\nPopulation, 65+\n\n\n2019 Population Estimates available from the Texas Demographic Center at https://demographics.texas.gov/Data/TPEPP/Estimates/.\n\n\nPopulation, Phase 1A Healthcare Workers\n\n\nPhase 1A healthcare workers estimates include people providing direct care in hospitals, EMS, long-term care facilities, home health and hospice and those providing direct care in Offices of Physicians, Other Healthcare providers like physical therapists and Mental Health Providers, Outpatient Care Centers, Medical and Diagnostic Laboratories, Freestanding ER and Urgent Care, Other Ambulatory Care, Pharmacies, Last responders who provide mortuary or death services, Public health and emergency response staff directly involved in administration of COVID testing and vaccinations, and school nurses. Data on frontline and vulnerable populations in Texas come from the 2018 Annual Survey of Hospitals (total number of employees), DSHS EMS Registry, Texas Pharmacy Board, Texas Education Agency, 2019 Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages (https://texaslmi.com/LMIbyCategory/QCEW), and the HHSC Directory of Long-term Care Providers (https://hhs.texas.gov/doing-business-hhs/provider-portals/long-term-care-providers).\n\n\nPopulation, Phase 1A Long-term Care Residents\n\n\nLong-term care resident estimates include licensed capacity of Nursing Homes, Assisted Living, Adult Day Care and Activity Centers, and Intermediate Care for People with Intellectual Disabilities.\n\n\nPopulation, Phase 1B Any Medical Condition\n\n\nPeople 16 years of age and older with at least one chronic medical condition that puts them at increased risk for severe illness from the virus that causes COVID-19. The data are model-based estimates from CDC using self-reported data from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System and U.S. census population data. The methodology for generating these estimates are detailed in this MMWR: https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/wr/mm6929a1.htm.\n\n\nPopulation, Education and Child Care Personnel\n\n\nEducation and child care personnel include estimates include elementary and secondary school employees (NAICS 6111), child day care services employees (NAICS 6244), school bus drivers (NAICS 485410 and NAICS 485510), and school cafeteria employees (NAICS 722310)\n\n\nUsing this data, we show the progress of vaccination against the available doses and the remaining population in different phases. A national comparison is showed by comparing Texas number of vaccines distributed per 100,000 people and number of vaccines administered per 100,000 people with other states. The data on other states has been obtained through CDC and it allows us to rank Texas against other states in these two measures.\nThe distribution trends are shown through bar charts for total doses shipped to different provider types and total doses available at each provider types. The provider type is the classification of vaccine sites by State. Total doses shipped include total number of vaccine doses provided to each provider type uptil now. The available doses number gives us the current stock position of vaccine at each provider type.\nThe vaccine pace tracker provides a detail view of vaccination drive at the state and county level. Using the data from DSHS, which is provided on state and county level, we are able to construct a bar chart which provides information in percentage form, what percentage of population has been given at least one dose and what percentage of population has been fully vaccinated. The actual numbers can be seen by hovering the mouse over the bars. Some of the metrics used in these graphs are given as follow:\n\n\nMetric\n\n\nEquation\n\n\n% of Population Partially vaccinated\n\n\n\\[ \\scriptsize \\frac{ \\text{No. of people given one dose}}{\\text{No. of people  16+ age}}*100\\]\n\n\n% of Population fully vaccinated\n\n\n\\[ \\scriptsize \\frac{\\text{No. of people fully vaccinated}}{\\text{No. of people 16+ age}}*100 \\]\n\n\nDaily Average\n\n\n\\[ \\scriptsize \\frac{\\text{Total doses administered}}{\\text{No. of days since start of vaccination}} \\]\n\n\nWhen 70% of Pop is vaccinated\n\n\n\\[ \\scriptsize \\text{Today} + \\frac{\\text{No. of doses required to vaccinate remaining 70%  of Eligible Population}}{\\text{Average Daily Rate of dose administration}} \\]\n\n\nPhotography Credit\nPhoto by Noita Digital on Unsplash\n\n\n\n",

At a high level, this chart is a single box that represents everyone in Texas aged 16 years and older. Within the box, you can see how much of is made up of eligible phases and how much of it is made up of the remaining population aged 16 years and older. And then, two lines mark the following:\nDoses Shipped: How many doses have been shipped compared to the entire 16+ population?\nPersons Fully Vaccinated: How many people have been fully vaccinated compared to the entire 16+ population?\n\n\n\nNational Comparison\n\n\n\nDistribution Trends\nThe next chart captures where the reported supply of doses has been distributed, by the type of vaccine provider. The state classifies provider types, which allows to see very simply: what kinds of providers have recently received shipments of doses and how much were they shipped?\n\n\n\nSimilar to the last one, this chart focuses on reported availability. In other words, how much of the shipped doses are provider types reporting to be still available at the time the chart was generated?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVaccine Pace Tracker\nThe last tool to track the pace of distribution is an interactive comparison of the state and counties across Texas. The tool allows users to track the statewide pace of vaccine progress and the county-level pace of vaccine progress. Because the state is only focused on the population aged 16 and above, we only measure progress against this population.\nQuestion | Why do they only measure the population aged 16 and above?\n According to the Texas Department of State Health Services, “At this time, experts do not know how safe the COVID-19 vaccine is for children. People 16 years old and older are currently eligible to get the vaccine if they are in a priority population.”\nThe two charts represent the entire populations of the state and selected county. In the boxes below, there are three indicators.\nDose Distribution: This box shows how many doses have been administered out of the doses that have actually been allocated to that entity (either the state or the selected county).\nDaily Average: This is an ongoing calculation of daily averages that starts on Dec 15. The only thing it considers is how many doses are going into arms each day.\nWhen 70% is Vaccinated: Based on that daily average and knowing most of the approved vaccines require two doses, this box tries to guesstimate when 70% of the population aged 16 and older will be vaccinated. This is not a herd immunity projection, rather a look ahead as to when most of the population aged 16 and older will likely be vaccinated.\n\n\n\n\nPhotography Credit\nPhoto by CDC on Unsplash\n\n\n\n",
