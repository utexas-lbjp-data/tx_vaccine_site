To learn more about whether or not you are currently eligible, please read the “Eligible Populations” section below.\nEligible Populations\nRight now, the state has highlighted two phases of the Texas Population that are eligible to receive available COVID-19 vaccines: Phase 1A and Phase 1B. To learn more about each of the populations, expand the summaries below.\nEligible Population | Phase 1A\nBelow is a description of the Phase 1A population, as described by the Texas Department of State Health Services.\nPhase 1A\nFirst Tier\nPaid and unpaid workers in hospital settings working directly with patients wh* are positive or at high risk for COVID-19. Such as but not limited to:\nPhysicians, nurses, respiratory therapists and other support staff (custodial staff, etc.)\nAdditional clinical staff providing supporting laboratory, pharmacy, diagnostic and/or rehabilitation services\nOthers having direct contact with patients or infectious materials\nLong-term care staff working directly with vulnerable residents.

While there’s a lot of unknowns in the data–particularly across entries for “Race/Ethnicity”+“Gender”–and also because we don’t have the population estimates for phases 1A and 1B broken down by race/age/gender, the data presented by DSHS struggles to paint an incomplete picture of the profile of vaccinated individuals. That said, the charts below attempt to breakdown that data with as much clarity as possible across all known and unknown classifcations.\nThe first chart is broken up into six different panels–one for each classification of a race or ethnicity. Within each of those panels, there’s two sets of five-columned bar charts which represent the reported gender. The dark blue colored bars (facing upwards) represent the female population within each race and ethnicity classification while the gray colored bars (facing downwards) represent the male population within each race and ethnicity classification. Each column within a set of blue or gray colored bars represents a different age group.\n\n\n\nThe next chart captures where reported availability of doses is distributed by the of vaccine provider. The state classifies provider types, which allows to see very simply: what kinds of providers have recently reported having available doses and how much do they have?\n\nPhotography Credit\nPhoto by Daniel Schludi on Unsplash\n\n\n\n",

At a thirty thousand foot level, this chart is a single box that represents everyone in Texas aged 16 years and older. Within the box, you can see how much of is made up of eligible phases and how much of it is made up of the remaining population aged 16 years and older. And then, two lines mark the following:\nDoses Shipped: How many doses have been shipped compared to the entire 16+ population?\nPersons Fully Vaccinated: How many people have been fully vaccinated compared to the entire 16+ population?\n\n\n\nThe next chart captures where reported availability of doses is distributed by the of vaccine provider.
